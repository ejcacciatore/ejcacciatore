# Hi, I'm Enrico Cacciatore

**Founder of [Sapinover](https://github.com/ejcacciatore) | Market Microstructure Research & Financial Technology**

I build data-driven tools and platforms focused on market microstructure, Alternative Trading Systems (ATS), and overnight equity markets. My work sits at the intersection of financial data analysis, interactive visualization, and web development.
